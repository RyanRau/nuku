# Wikipedia Web Scraper (Nuku) & List of Extinct Animals
To make my projects sound more interesting and to pay my respects, I name my projects after extinct animals (this one is named after the Nuku Niva Rail [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuku_Hiva_rail)). To better help me with my odd naming scheme I whipped up this webscrapper to generate lists of extinct animals from data found on wikipedia.
Currently there are lists corresponding the the main regions found on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_extinct_animals) page.

This scraper will get the first column of any table on a given wikipedia page.

## How to run
``` bash
# python 3.9.0

pip install -r requirements.txt
python scraper.py
```
